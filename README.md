# Sudoku-project
Sudoku is a logic puzzle played on a 9x9 grid subdivided into 9 3x3 subgrids. The player is presented a partially filled puzzle, and must complete it following these rules:  
1. Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats!) 
2. Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats!) 
3. Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats!)

This program tests if a Sudoku puzzle follows all these rules and compares two puzzles to see if they are the same or different.
